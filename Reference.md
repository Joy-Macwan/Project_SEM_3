Act like you are Professional JS Website Developer.

I want to create a website like E-Commerce Electronics Store:
Seller can upload device's Images.
Add to cart, etc...
It's based on 
1)Repair(if Someone has Problem in his device like Smart Phone, Laptop, Washing machine etc... that device repair at low cost, etc..).
2)Reuse(like someone upgrade laptop then his old laptop sell at lower price and another person can buy at low price. etc...).
3)reduce(like laptop is very old then seller donate or sell at very low Price and its parts use for another device's repair, etc..).
Project with All other pages like Register/login, home, etc..
Make All features and Functionalities.
Note: All New Modules in New Files(Means Login page has its own files, A new feature like Add to cart, Home page's Listing Devices, etc...
Output Not in Canvas and Not Give Code/Database.
